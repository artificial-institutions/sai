This application extends the link:https://github.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo/tree/develop/demos/sanction[JaCaMo __sanction__ demo]. In this implementation, the activation of norms and sanctions includes institutional facts.



It implements the following "history":

1. A norm is activated and obliges Alice to do something in 3 seconds. The norm is:
```
    norm n1: vl(X) & X > 5
       -> obligation(alice,n1, b(0), `now`+`3 seconds`)
       if unfulfilled: s1(alice,X).
```
The activation condition ```vl(V)``` is constituted from the state of a clock, according to the following constitutive rule:
```
 nticks(clock,V) count-as  vl(V) while V==5000.
```
2. Alice does not fulfill the obligation on time!

3. The sanction rule `s1` is thus triggered and its consequence is an obligation for Bob to fine Alice. The sanction specification is:
```
    sanction s1(A,X): c(Y) -> obligation(bob,true,fine(A,X*Y),`now`+`2 seconds`)
       if unfulfilled: s2.
```
The condition for sanctoning ```c(Y)``` is also constituted from the state of clock, according to the following constitutive rule:
```
nticks(clock,V) count-as c(V).
```

4. Bob also decides to not fulfill its obligation!

5. So, sanction rule `s2` is triggered and its consequence is an institutional fact. The specification is:
```
    sanction s2 -> remove_from_systems(bob).
```

6. In this case, the sanction is implemented (instrumented) in the environment. An artifact executes an operation to realize  `remove_from_systems(bob)`. However, for other application, it could be an agent that is responsible to handle the fact `remove_from_systems(bob)`.

## Notes

* The specification of the norms and sanctions are in file link:./src/org/demo.npl[demo.npl]
* The institutional specification is in file link:./src/org/constitutive.sai[constitutive.sai]

* The application is executed by agent Karlos that:

  - Creates the artifact `NormativeBoard` that is responsible to compute obligations and sanctions based on the normative specification of `demo.npl`.
  - Creates the artifact link:./src/env/police/Sanctioner.java[`Sanctioner`] that is responsible to implement in the environment the (brute) consequences of sanctions.
  - Connects the `NormativeBoard` to the institution set in link:sanction.jcm[sanction.jcm].
  - Sets up the clock that produces the environmental facts that further constitute institutional facts.
  - Monitors the normative events and prints some of them.

* Since we are focused on the normative events, agents Alice and Bob do not exist in the application.

* Two kinds of sanctions rules are conceived in the language:

   - sanctions rules that produce obligations for  agents (sanction `s1` in this demo).
   - sanctions rules that produces (institutional) facts of type sanction (sanction `s2` in this demo). As illustrated in this demo, these facts may lead to _regimented_ sanctions when they are instrumented in the environment --there is no way to "scape" from its consequences. It mimics human sanctions like automatic fines produced by traffic light controllers. However these facts may be read by agents that decide how to proceed with the sanction. 

## Result of the execution

To run the demo, execute `./gradlew` in the demo folder:

```
[karlos] Unfulfilled obligation(alice,(vl(20) & (20 > 5)),b(0),"2023-10-5 18:49:18")[created("2023-10-5 18:49:15"),norm(n1,[["X",20]]),unfulfilled("2023-10-5 18:49:18")]
[karlos] Sanction obligation(bob,true,fine(alice,200),"now + 1 seconds"),sanction(s1,[...])] created for norm n1 that is unfulfilled
[karlos] Unfulfilled obligation(bob,true,fine(alice,200),"2023-10-5 18:49:20")[created("2023-10-5 18:49:18"),norm(s1,[...]),sanction(s1,[...]),unfulfilled("2023-10-5 18:49:20")]
[karlos] Sanction remove_from_systems(bob)[created("2023-10-5 18:49:20"),norm(s1,unfulfilled,s2),sanction(s2,[])] created for norm s1 that is unfulfilled
