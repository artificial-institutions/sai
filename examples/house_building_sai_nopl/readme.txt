This is a "sitauted" version of the classical house_built example. The dynamic facts that animate the NOPL dynamics are constituted  from the environment instead of being produced by operations in the artifacts. The constitutive specification is in /src/org/constitutive.sai


Running the example:
(1) in Eclipse, import the project as a JaCaMo project and run it as usual

or

(2) in a terminal, type #jacamo house.jcm.


While the example is running:

 To check the constitutive state, go to
   - http://localhost:3275/bh

The normative state can be checked in the Organisation Inspector, as usual in JaCaMo applications.
